# Snakestrap
Like most people, I got sick of copying the same code into new projects. Snakestrap is my personal set of Sass starter files including helpers, a flexible grid, and very light styling for common elements.

Snakestrap uses the [MIT open source license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Feel free to use all or parts of Snakestrap on your own projects. 

## The name
Snakestrap is a lame and silly combination of a nickname of mine and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), the amazing CSS framework that greatly inspires this one.

# What's included

## Reset
Snakestrap uses [Eric Meyer's reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). It's what I've been using since I first learned CSS.

## Fonts
I'm using [Open Sans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sans) as my base type because of its range of styles and its readability at small sizes. You can download Open Sans at [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans).

I'm also a big fan of [Symbolset](https://symbolset.com/). I tend to use [Standard](https://symbolset.com/icons/standard) and [Social](https://symbolset.com/icons/social-regular) on all of my projects for their simplicity and ability to adapt to many different designs. You can download those or any of their other great sets [here](https://symbolset.com/icons).

## Variables
Still working on itâ€¦
